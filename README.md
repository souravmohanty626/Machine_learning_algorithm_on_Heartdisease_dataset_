# Machine_learning_algorithm_on_Heartdisease_dataset_
We have used python libraries:

1. Numpy:  It is a Python library that provides a multidimensional array &  derived object.
2.Pandas: It is a python library used to visualize the data.
3.Matplotlib: Matplotlib is a comprehensive library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.
4.Seaborn: Seaborn is a python library that uses Matplotlib underneath to plot graphs.
5.LogisticRegression: It is used for predictions & classification problems. 

## We have a data which classified if patients have heart disease or not according to features in it. We will try to use this data to create a model which tries predict if a patient has this disease or not. We will use logistic regression (classification) algorithm ##

**we are applying ML Algorithms like:**
  
  * KNN Algorithm
  * Decision Tree Algorithm
  * Logistics Regression
  * RANDOM FOREST Algorithm
  * Naive Bayes Algorithm
  * Support Vector Machine(SVM)
